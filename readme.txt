== Description ==

This plugin was developed to improve integration with WooCommerce. It adds extra webhook topics.

With this plugin, you can get webhook notifications for shopping cart updates, for example when the item is added or deleted.

WooCommerce shopping cart doesnâ€™t provide the ability to get webhook notifications for basket updates, and API2Cart developed this functionality itself.
